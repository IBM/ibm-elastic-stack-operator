    Operator that installs and manages Elastic Stack logging service instances

    ## Overview
    Each Elastic Stack instance provides user-friendly visibility to system/application
      logs by collecting, transforming, storing, presenting and archiving logs in a 
      secure, scalable and customizable way. Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana,
      Curator and Nginx are the main components

    ## Key Features
    ### Tenant Isolation
    - Multiple customizd Logging instances can be deployed individually
    - For each instance, isolation in hardware resource, data storage, data transportation, access control, encryption and retention policy
    - Tenant instance provisioning/deprovisioning can be driven by automation scripts. All customization points controlled by parameters

    ### Resource Customization
    - Node affinity
    - Resource limits, heap size, replica, etc
    - Namespace
    - Storage classes for data persistence

    ### Security
    - Traffic between the follow components are secured with mutual TLS:
      - filebeat - logstash
      - logstash - elasticsearch
      - elasticsearch - kibana
      - curator - elasticsearch
    - Elasticsearch access control based on user role and namespac access. None admin users cannot see logs outside of their own namespace (need IBM IAM)
    - Kibana access control based on user role and namespace. None admin users cannot access Kibana if required namespace access is missing (need IBM IAM)
    - Both self-signed TLS keys, as well as bring-your-own signing CA
    - Kibana authentication Login page with integrated Identity Management (need IBM IAM)

    ### Platform and Architecutres
    - Supports and validated on amd64, IBM s390x, IBM Power PC
    - Supports and validated on Openshift 3.11, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, IBM Cloud Private 3.21

    ### Log pipeline customization
    - Collect log only from workloads on selected hosts
    - Collect log only from workloads in configurable namespaces

    ### Data Retention
    - Customize data retention policy for individual indices
    - Customize data retention job schedule

    ### Stability
    - Persistent queue to buffer traffic surges
    - Persistent log harvest pointers to avoid payload replay upon node restart
    
    ### Usablity
    - Automatically set kibana default index and timestamp fields upon start
    - Customizable kibana endpoint url (e.g. https://1.2.3.4:8443/tenant-a-kibana)
    - Zero user intervention two-way data migration between Elastic stack 5.5 and 6.6 (Elasticsearch and Kibana)

    ## Capacity Planning
    The Elastic Stack is designed to handle large amounts of log data. The more
      data that you choose to retain, the more resources it requires. You could
      prototype the cluster and applications before full production deployment
      to measure the impact of log data on your system
    
    ### Default Resource Allocation is Minimal
    The default memory and disk allocation for the in the Elastic Stack CR is not
      intended for production use. Actual production usage might be much higher.
      The default values provide a starting point for prototyping and other
      demonstration efforts

    ### Some Notes on Capacity Planning
    - The Elastic stack works better by scaling out (adding more identical
      pod instances) than scaling up (adding more memory to fixed number of pods)
    - Elasticsearch pod heap size, pod memory limit, replica are some examples of key tuining points
    - Deploy and validate in lab and staging environments before going to production
    - Keep track of resource allocations and monitor workload periodically

    ## Installing in Namespaces Other than kube-system
    Additional permissions might be needed
